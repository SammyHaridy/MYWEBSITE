                <h2>BACKGROUND INFO</h2>
                <p>My name is Sammy Haridy. I'm enrolled in Brooklyn Technical High School in the finance major, and on the side, I'm privileged to attend the All Star Code Summer Intensive. I've come to learn much so far, but I know I've barely scratched the surface. I'm still learning the basics, so I'm not yet proficient in any language as of now. This website marks my first debut in my lengthy career of computer science.</p>

                <h2>MY BACKSTORY</h2>
                <p>Starting off in Brooklyn, I attended an Islamic school for elementary and middle school. My father is Egyptian, my mother Moroccan. I always preferred my Moroccan side, as I was closer to them. As a child, my career interests never remained the same, but one of them was engineering. It took me until high school to stumble upon computer science. At first it was the money, but the experience of coding trumped my greed.</p>

                <h2>PASTTIMES</h2>
                <p>For me, cooking and working out go hand in hand. I only recently picked up the spatula, about three years ago, and the dumbbell about two. I enjoy making delicious and wild dishes, sometimes (failing while) trying to make them healthy. As for lifting weights, what better a feeling than developing your mind and body? These hobbies go hand in hand, as nutrition is important for growing your body and muscles.</p>
